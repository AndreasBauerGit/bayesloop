class ChangepointStudy(RasterStudy):
    """
    This class builds on the RasterStudy-class and the change-point transition model to perform a series of analyses
    with varying change point times. It subsequently computes the average model from all possible change points and
    creates a probability distribution of change point times. It supports any number of change-points and arbitarily
    combined models.

        """
        This method over-rides the according method of the Raster Study-class. It runs the algorithm for all possible
        combinations of change-points (and possible scans a range of values for other hyper-parameters). The posterior
        sequence represents the average model of all analyses. Posterior mean values are computed from this average
        model.

        Parameters:
            raster - While the class ChangepointStudy automatically iterates over all possible combinations of
                     change-points, it is possible to provide an additional list of lists with each containing the name
                     of a hyper-parameter together with a lower and upper boundary as well as a number of steps in
                     between.
                     Example: raster = [['sigma', 0, 1, 20],['log10pMin', -10, -5, 10]]

            forwardOnly - If set to True, the fitting process is terminated after the forward pass. The resulting
                posterior distributions are so-called "filtering distributions" which - at each time step -
                only incorporate the information of past data points. This option thus emulates an online
                analysis.

            evidenceOnly - If set to True, only forward pass is run and evidence is calculated. In contrast to the
                forwardOnly option, no posterior mean values are computed and no posterior distributions are stored.

            silent - If set to True, no output is generated by the fitting method.

        Returns:
            None
